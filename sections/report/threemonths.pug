h1(class="reportTitle" id="August-17") August, September and October 2017

p.text This report, which is supposed to be monthly, is published after three months. I collaborated with a third party organization in experimenting an analysis based on the scraping of links from social media links and trackers analysis. At the moment I'm writing, beginning of November 2017, a report is in development (is not related to trackers analysis), and the opportunity raised a new research branch in this research.

    h2 Social media observer and realtime analysis
    p.text One of the challenges in web analysis is the impossibility to test all the condition in which a user will navigate. Making a common assumption, you can end up in doing a mass study but not to spot some targeted web surveillance because the script you hope to catch will just trigger in specific content.
    p.text The state of art solutions are:
    ul
        li permitting to experts in providing their list (as per personal experience, it quite hard gets people self-profile their community and report back generic but detailed links)
        li Exporting your browsing history, in this year a good improvement has been made by EDRI fellow 
            a(href="http://www.privacypies.org/blog/metadata/2017/02/28/hakuna-metadata-1.html") Sid with Hackuna metadata
            |, I don't think I can explore more in that direction.
        li Monitor only the homepage (this is what me or WebTAP of Princeton University did), and increase the size of the tested sites. But this can't see when a specific tracker runs only on few selected pages of the site.
    p.text Considering how Facebook and Google are the 
        a(href="https://staltz.com/the-web-began-dying-in-2014-heres-how.html") de-facto gatekeepers of the WWW
        |, the most appropriate solution to monitor the quality of web pages, is look at what is effectively provided by these platform. But, in order to do so, you have to observe the personalized experience of the users. With a browser extension is it possible collects the links appearing in an user timeline (or the one shared by a selected community), and analyzed them. 
    p.text This approach is currently in use, and will provide output during the month.

    h2 LatAm realtime tracking experiment
    p.text A work in progress is the analysis of the links shared by Argentinian media and political figures, this permits to test a new branch of research, in which the links are collected dinamically instead of be pick by researchers.

    h2 Analysis of javascript tracking behavior
    p.text Has been implemented the usage of Chrome with PrivacyBadger as part of the testing suite, this permit the first javascript fingerprinting and visual reporting.

    p.text This result can be fetched via API (i.e.: https://invi.sible.link/api/v1/details/itatopex ), it contains most of the javascript calls usable in browser fingerprinting.

    h2 JS details visualization 
    p.text The interface wannts to show graphically what the third parties can potentially access. Every campaign is producing this outut daily, the incomplete visualization can be this example from the Cilean online clinics:
