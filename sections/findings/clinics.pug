    h3 Abstract
    p.text To test the concept of the context-targeted campaign, we analyzed web trackers in online clinics. The pages of such websites contains explanation of medical treatment and exams available in a hospital. A website like these can leak through the navigation sequence, which is the medial issue of a user (eventually, correlated among multiple clinics, time spent in the pages)
    p.text Third-party trackers can even don't know anything on the website in which they are running, but metadata such as the interest of a user for a cluster or web pages are metadata attributed by AI analyzing the analytics, and in the case of a medical condition, that's a protected selector.
    p.text
        b Our findings show how, advanced interactive experience for the user, leak potentially much more private information through third parties.

                |  the HTTP connection made by the browser to compose a web-page; It could be just one connection enough but on average 
            li B 
                b Third-party
                |  a resource loaded via HTTP belonging to a domain name which is not the one contacted originally by the client

                b Company
                |  is the given name of the business organization owing a third party. This association is done when a known domain name (google-analytics.com) can be linked to a company name (Google).
            li D 
                b Javascript
                |  The code executed client side, which open the attack surface much more than a picture, an HTML or a CSS. a Javascript is necessary to implement advanced fingerprinting techniques used to re-link users behavior without using cookies (which are, in theory, the only legit way to perform users tracking)
    p.text In the report the analysis is focus on B and D, the visualizations used have a code number, the Viz#1 is on C, Viz#2 on B, Viz#3 on D.

                    | correlated to third-party resources; the class of contents have the same color and should be consistent in most of the graphs on this report, except where diversly explain. 
                p.text Commonly analysts don't talk of third-party trackers, after all, it is a technical term often replaced by the broader acknowledge concept of "digital advertising". But this is not always true, especially in specialized websites such as healthcare, advertising is extremely rare.
                p.text Is not my scope analyze Companies presence and behavior, but as you can see below, they represent a significant amount of the third party connections; Using Tableau is simply highlight the set of company-attributed third-party resources and 
                    i exclude them in further analysis.

        |  This graph highlights the amount of third-party connections attributed to known platforms. They can be judged by the advocacy team, for our analysis the intention was to remove them before going deeper.

    img(class="img-responsive" src="/images/BR-clinics-3rd.png")

    p.text Considering "attack surface" the amount of javascript and resources served by a third party, the most contributors are not the well-known corporation observed in the Viz#1, but rather specialized services such as wix.com; wix.com is a technology to create websites, it serves the web app framework, and besides the traditional cookies uses localStorage in two different instances:
    img.img-responsive(src="/images/carlos+wix.png")

    p.text Although carloschagas.com.br looks like the websites with more inclusion, the invasiveness is relatively low. 

    p.text 
        code www.fleaming-lab.com.br
        |  hospital displays a different pattern: do not include third-parties except the well-known Google+Facebook and the javascript doing more invasive operation are native to the first party domain:
    img.img-responsive(src="/images/fleming.png")

    p.text This is a logic in which a website offering a complex web app could gain more knowledge on usability locally, rather then delocalize the information. The pattern seems the one of an evercookie, a mechanism which can re-link user behavior even if the user deletes cookies, but no hardware fingerprint is involved. An open question if the system links profiles collected when the user is non-logged to the customer profile (a logged user)

    h3 Reliability of time-comparison
    p.text One of the aspects I was intended to explore with invi.sible.link, is the possibility of monitor how third-party trackers change after updated. This is actually possible, the API implemented permits to download the results of the past, but how much can we compare the trend?

    p.text In the visualization below we get a numeric comparison of the consistency of the checks, it display the number of inclusion count. This assessment has little value for security purposes but helps to get a grasp on the stability of the test performed with PhantomJS. The number represent the amount of javascript loaded, every day, from all the chiliean clinics in analysis:
    img.img-responsive(src="/images/js-included-chillean-clinics.png")

    p.text
        b How explain the frequent changes?
    p.text The benefit of having an analysis performed every night is the comparison in the long term. It is quite disappointing to discover how frequently the third party trackers change. Three different vantage point can even perform the analysis, and the time dedicated to every session reach 1 minute each to permit every resource to load in machines, considering the loading of third-party resources 
    p.text Some reasons could the web structure change, for the infrastructural reason, CDNs, caches or marketing agreements. This last is not expected in the clinics because their business model (should not be) advertising, but in a different context the dynamic loading of ads causes very variable inclusions links.
    p.text Considering the dependency map of third-party loaded (courtesy of Evidon):
    img.img-responsive(src="/images/TMZ-analysis-EVIDON.png")
    p.text Looking at the example above, if we take into consideration resources such as Taboola, with additional third-parties loaded after it gets rendered, we see how hardly replicable this graph can be across multiple tests.
